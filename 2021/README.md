# Advent of Code 2021

For this year I will try to solve them problems using
[julia](https://julialang.org/) and
[FORTRAN](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran). I don't care about performance, so
the code will be fun to look at. When the data of a day have a nice visual
representation, there will be some kind of plot alongside.
